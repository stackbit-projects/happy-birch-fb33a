      - question: Do you offer a setup or data import service?
        answer: >-
          Yes! We understand there's a lot to get setup before your team can
          make full use of the system. We offer a bespoke onboarding solution to
          all customers. This currently includes bulk setup of staff user
          accounts, and import policies. You can provide policies to us in most
          document formats including PDF and Word Doc.

          We offer this solution at a flat rate of £199.
