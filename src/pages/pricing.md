      - question: Do you offer a setup or data import service?
        answer: >-
          Yes! We understand there's a lot to get setup before your team can
          make full use of the system. We offer a bespoke onboarding solution to
          all customers. This currently includes bulk setup of staff user
          accounts, and importing of policies. You can provide policies to us in
          most document formats including PDF and Word Doc.

          We offer this solution at a flat rate of £199.
      - question: What is classed as an 'active' user?
        answer: >-
          A user is classed as *active* from the point at which they are added
          to your organisation. A user is no longer classed as active if they
          are deleted, or removed from your organisation. The term active does
          not refer to how often the user logs in to, or interacts with the
          system.
      - question: What does email support include?
        answer: >-
          Email support is as simple as it sounds. You'll have access to your
          account manager via email. We pride ourselves on great customer
          support, and do our best to get back to all support queries the same
          working day.
