      - question: Do you offer a setup or data import service?
        answer: >-
          Yes! We understand there's a lot to get setup before your team can
          make full use of the system. We offer a bespoke onboarding solution to
          all customers. This currently includes bulk setup of staff user
          accounts, and import policies. You can provide policies to us in most
          document formats including PDF and Word Doc.

          We offer this solution at a flat rate of £199.
      - question: What is classed as an 'active' user?
        answer: >-
          A user is classed as *active* from the point at which they are added
          to your organisation. A user is no longer classed as active if they
          are deleted, or removed from your organisation. The term active does
          not refer to how often the user logs in to, or interacts with the
          system.
      - question: Sed scelerisque in ipsum eu sollicitudin?
        answer: >-
          Nullam quis ultrices ipsum. Integer eleifend laoreet quam, ac
          dignissim nisi mollis eget. Ut vitae nisi sit amet nisi suscipit
          dictum faucibus eget magna. Vivamus in hendrerit magna, non
          pellentesque metus. Morbi orci odio, dictum at efficitur sit amet,
          luctus in ipsum. Nunc pellentesque mi vel dui vulputate, a lobortis
          lacus venenatis. Phasellus pellentesque dolor id feugiat faucibus.
          Etiam vehicula nunc velit, in consequat nisl feugiat nec.
